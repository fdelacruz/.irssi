# Shrike.theme by Riku Lindblad

# these characters are automatically replaced with specified color
replaces = { "[]<>=" = "%K$0-%n"; };

# %n specifies the color set in higher level, like in
#   {ctcp {nick $0-} requested ... }
# if the ctcp was specified as "%g$0-" and nick was "%W$0-%n", the
# "requested" text would be green

# You also need these to make this theme fully functional:
# (To fill up the lower statusbar)
#
# Add this to your irssi config, in the statusbar = {} section
